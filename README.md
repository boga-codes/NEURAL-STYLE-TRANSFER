**DESCRIPTION:**
**Neural Style Transfer (NST)** is a deep learning technique that blends the **artistic style** of one image with the **content** of another, creating stunning visual results. It leverages **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**‚Äîparticularly models like **VGG-19**‚Äîto isolate and recombine the **style and content** of images.

The process involves three images:

* **Content image**: The base structure or subject
* **Style image**: The artistic design or texture
* **Generated image**: The final output combining both

NST works by:

* Extracting **content features** from deeper CNN layers
* Capturing **style features** from shallower layers
* Using **loss functions** to measure content and style differences
* Applying **gradient descent** to iteratively update the generated image

This technique enables the creation of images that **maintain the structure of the original subject while adopting the artistic flair** of the chosen style. It is widely used in art generation, photo filters, and AI-powered design tools, bridging the gap between **art and artificial intelligence**.
